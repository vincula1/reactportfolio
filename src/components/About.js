            Hi, I'm Laith. My time at the UT bootcamp is soon coming to an official close, and although it's ending, I am glad I went through this experience. I learned so much along the way, and this course has further ignited my passion for computer science. I have developed a serious interest in AI engineering through introspection during the bootcamp, mainly fascinated by the complex algorithms that power today's most advanced systems. This has also expanded my interest into broader concepts such as machine learning and more, which I plan to delve into in the future. In my personal time, I enjoy writing, having fun with close friends, and satisfying my curiosity by exploring the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            My learning about algorithms and profound interest in this field have motivated me to pursue further education at UT Austin, where I aim to learn more complex concepts and expand my portfolio. Here, you will find some simple projects I have made along the way. Please explore thoroughly and see what you like!
